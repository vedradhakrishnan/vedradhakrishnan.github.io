13 million meters is the longest Euclidean distance
separating two individuals on earth. I envision
13MHyperloop as an ed-tech initiative which can
instantly connect with any middle and highschooler on
earth to bring the art, joy, knowledge, and joy of coding,
AI, art, design, and music through my portfolios and
projects.

Sharing my love of learning and my passion of coding,
Al, and music with disadvantaged youth, middle-
schoolers, and high school friends has inspired me to
13MmHyperloop, an ed tech non-profit initiative whose
mission is to offer a learning and networking platform to
connect middle-schoolers and high-schoolers.
