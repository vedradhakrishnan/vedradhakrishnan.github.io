title: About
---

I'm Ved, and I'm an 18-year-old student at New York University majoring in Math and Computer Science. My interests span from Robotics to Machine Learning to Control Systems and more. I'm an avid programmer who loves working on personal projects, and I have a passion to share my programming and STEM knowledge with others in my community. I'm also a frequent composer and Music Producer, and I enjoy combining both of my passions in several projects, as well as through my music discography.

I'd love to connect; feel free to reach out through email: vedaradhak@gmail.com
